# Foreword by Hao Tang

Developing frontend codebases may seem easy, but it is indeed a complex task. It's not just about writing code, but also
about organizing, maintaining, and scaling the codebase.

Over the years, numerous frontend technologies and tools have emerged, each with different approaches, "ways," or "best
practices" for developing applications. In web and mobile app development, the
plethora of solutions and patterns often leaves developers confused about which one to choose and which approach to
follow. This is particularly problematic in the JavaScript ecosystem, where the overwhelming number of options has led
to what is commonly known as "JavaScript Fatigue." And this is just one example among many like below.

## The No Architecture

Developers often start writing code without any architecture or structure, simply putting code into files. While this
approach makes it easy to start, it becomes difficult to maintain and scale. It's akin to building a house without a
blueprintâ€”manageable for a small house, but disastrous for a larger one. This lack of planning is like constructing a
house without proper engineering.

Codebases built in this way become difficult to maintain, scale, and onboard new developers. This disorganized mess is
commonly referred to as **The Big Ball of Mud**.

## The absence of Programming Principles and Philosophies

**"Don't be so serious, it's just a frontend dude!"**

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that as long as the UI works and the demo is successful, nothing else
matters. This mindset often leads to deprioritizing code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

Some developers, both frontend and backend, write code without understanding or being aware of essential programming
principles and philosophies. This lack of foundational knowledge can lead to codebases that are difficult to manage and
extend.
