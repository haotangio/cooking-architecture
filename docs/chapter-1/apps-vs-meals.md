# Apps vs Meals

## Similarities between cooking and frontend development

- **High exposed**: Both are highly exposed to the user. The user know what ingredients are used and how it is cooked.
- **Ingredients**: Both require the right ingredients to create a successful dish or app.
- **Recipes**: Both require a recipe to follow to create a dish or app.
- **Taste**: Both require the dish or app to taste good to the user - aka the User Experience (UX)
- **Presentation**: Both require the dish or app to look good to the user.
- **Low Reusability**: Chefs don't use the same ingredients to cook different dishes. Similarly, frontend developers
  don't use the same UI components to build different apps except low-level libraries.
